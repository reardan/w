Pointers Project


Description:
    You will implement features that enable better handling of pointers by the W Language.
    Currently, char* and int are two of the main types in use by the compiler.
    However they are broken in different ways involving the &, *, [] operators.
    We need to correct the handling of these operators for char, int16, int32, struct.



Specific Scenarios:
    value = *char_ptr
    *char_ptr = value
    
    value = int_ptr[3]
    int_ptr[4] = value

    field_value = struct_ptr.field_name
    struct_ptr.field_name = new_value

    field_value = struct_list[5].field
    struct_list[6].field_value = new_value


Language Features Touched:
    &
    *
    []
    struct


Project Files:
    grammar.w

    type_table.w


Functions
    grammar.w
        promote()
        expression()
        type_name()
        statement()
        program()

    symbol_table.w
        sym_get_value()


Acceptance Tests:
    make tests will pass
    make pointer_test will pass
        subset for each milestone
