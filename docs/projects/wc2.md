# wc2: leaf AST compiler

First two implementation tasks for [#488](https://github.com/reardan/w/issues/488).
`wc2` lowers the parser-generator W tree into an AST with explicit expression
precedence, block membership, scopes and source spans. It exposes AST inspection
and emits Linux x86 executables for a small integer/function/return subset.

```sh
./wbuild wc2
bin/wc2 --dump-ast path/to/program.w
bin/wc2 path/to/program.w -o bin/program
bin/program
```

Successful `--dump-ast` output is deterministic JSON (schema 1). Invalid or unsupported
input produces location-bearing diagnostics on stderr, no stdout, and exit
status 1. Incorrect command-line arguments return 2.

## Supported foundation

The initial subset covers `int`, `bool` and `void` type spellings; function
definitions and named parameters; global and local declarations; inferred
locals (`:=`); integer and boolean literals; names; unary `+ - ! ~`; arithmetic,
comparison, bitwise and logical operators; assignment and compound assignment;
ordinary calls; `return`, `if`/`elif`/`else`, `while`, `break`, `continue` and
`pass`. Bodies use colon blocks, including inline and empty bodies.

This is structural lowering, not a completed type checker. Declarations record
their builtin type; integer literals retain their spelling and an untyped
integer tag. Name bindings and inferred expression types remain unresolved.
Declaration visibility, duplicate names, argument/return compatibility, literal
width checking and target-specific integer interpretation are not part of the
dump. The executable path checks its narrower subset separately; general
name/type resolution remains a later task. A successful dump does not certify
that a program compiles.

Imports, structs, pointers, arrays, strings, floats, generics, prototypes,
default/variadic parameters, ternaries, non-call postfix operations, brace
blocks and multiline expressions are rejected explicitly. In particular,
multiline expressions cannot silently inherit `w.pg`'s permissive newline
joining. These restrictions bound the experiment without changing W itself.

## Executable subset (task 2)

The source must contain exactly one zero-argument `int main()` whose body is
exactly one `return` with a value. For example:

```w
int main():
	return 2 + 3 * 4
```

This compiles to an executable that exits with status 14. Expressions support
decimal/hex/binary integer literals, booleans, parentheses, unary `+ - ! ~`,
and binary `+ - * / % << >> & | ^ == != < <= > >= && ||`. Both logical
operators short-circuit and produce 0/1. Arithmetic uses signed 32-bit x86
operations, with wrapping add/subtract/multiply, arithmetic right shift,
hardware-masked shift counts, and signed division/remainder. Division by zero
and signed division overflow trap if evaluated, as on the production x86 path.
All 32 literal bits are accepted and interpreted as a signed value, independent
of the host compiler's word size; wider literals are diagnosed. This spike
does not yet reproduce production lint/style warnings for literal spellings.

`validate.w` checks the complete executable shape before emission, including
expressions on skipped logical branches. Extra functions, parameters,
declarations, names, calls, assignments, control flow, empty returns and extra
statements (even after a return) produce location-bearing diagnostics.
Executable expression nesting is capped at 200 to bound recursive emission.

`x86.w` emits from the semantic AST through the existing `libs/asm` structured
instruction encoder and byte buffer. Expression temporaries use a balanced
machine stack; each expression leaves its value in EAX. No production parser
or compiler globals are imported. `emit.w` adds a small static ELF32 header,
an entry stub that calls main and exits with its result, a read/execute load
segment, and a non-executable stack declaration. The production ELF writer
depends on global image, symbol and dynamic-linking state, so this leaf uses
its own minimal layout with shared integer field-writing helpers.

`wc2_emit(module)` returns an owned `asm_buffer`, or zero with module diagnostics.
The image remains valid after `wc2_module_free`; release it with `asm_buffer_free`.
Emission does not change AST nodes and can be repeated on a valid module.
Images are identical across 32-bit/64-bit emitter hosts and source filenames.
The CLI writes an exclusive sibling temporary and renames it only after a
complete write, preserving previous output on validation or I/O failure.
Compile success produces no stdout. Output is currently Linux x86 ELF only;
there is no architecture option, linking, debug metadata, or optimizer.

## Representation and ownership

`tools/wc2/ast.w` defines the nodes and module context. `wc2_parse(source, path)`
clones both arguments; the caller may immediately free them. Each module owns
its source, filename, token stream, parser tree, diagnostics, AST node table and
scope table. `wc2_module_free` releases these on success or failure. Multiple
modules can coexist without sharing compiler globals.

Node and scope IDs are local to one module and stable for its lifetime. Node
spans are half-open byte ranges; line and column are one-based. Children are
node IDs, and scopes contain parent/owner IDs and declaration IDs. `binding=-1`
and `type=-1` mean unresolved, not production-compiler table entries. Other
type tags are 0 (`int`), 1 (`bool`), 2 (`void`), 3 (integer literal).

| Node | Ordered children |
|---|---|
| module | top-level declarations |
| function | parameters, then body block |
| block | statements |
| declaration | optional initializer |
| return | optional value |
| if | condition, then block, optional else block or nested if |
| while | condition, body block |
| expression_statement / unary | expression / operand |
| binary / logical / assignment | left, right |
| call | callee, then arguments |
| parameter / integer / name / pass / break / continue | none |

Logical `&&`/`||` have their own node kind so code generation preserves
short-circuit evaluation. Binary operators follow the production grammar's
precedence and left associativity; assignment follows its right associativity.
The dump uses flat node/scope tables and contains no process addresses.

`tools/wc2/lower.w` flattens PG statement headers into source order and rebuilds
blocks using actual indentation. This is necessary because `w.pg` accepts any
positive indentation in a block and can attach a dedented sibling under an
inner statement. Its expression trees are lowered by `expressions.w`, which
reconstructs precedence from the PG's flat binary-operator sequence.

The PG runtime has an opt-in stream-owned AST mode. `wc2` enables it before
parsing and releases the stream rather than recursively freeing only the
returned root. This also frees abandoned backtracking/factored-prefix nodes
and error-recovery nodes. The ownership state is per stream; ordinary parser
callers retain the default independently owned tree behavior.

## Build and tests

The source-owned `wc2_parser` target generates `bin/wc2_parser.w` from the
existing `tests/parser_generator/w.pg`; `wc2` depends on it. A separate output
avoids racing the repository parser test's `bin/generated_w_parser.w`.
The production grammar and compile entry point do not import the leaf tool.
The small PG ownership helpers are shared runtime code and remain seed-safe.

```sh
./wbuild wc2_test wc2_64_test wc2_cli_test wc2_memory_test wc2_memory_64_test
./wbuild wc2_emit_test wc2_emit_64_test
./wbuild tests
```

Tests cover operator precedence/associativity, source spans, calls, scopes,
dedents and branch binding, unsupported syntax, independent module lifetimes,
JSON escaping and CLI exit/output contracts. The memory tests run in fresh
processes with the guard allocator and require zero outstanding allocations
after successful, failed, recovered and lexically invalid parses.
The executable tests compare 45 expression fixtures against `bin/wv2`, checking
full 32-bit results inside each program rather than only truncated exit codes.
They also cover ELF layout, byte-identical emission on both host widths,
unsupported programs, CLI failures and output preservation. Guard-allocator
tests include repeated emission and rejected out-of-range literals.

## Next task

Task 3 extends executable coverage to locals and assignment, parameters/calls,
`if`/`while`, then imports and structs. That requires real name/type resolution
and a function calling convention before broadening instruction selection.
Module invalidation, resident queries, the spike's measurements and the
production compiler migration remain later tasks. These first two tasks do
not close #488 or unblock all of #489.
