I'd like to migrate the code base to a tree structure.

The local structure on a per-project basis would be as follows:


/
	w
		owners
		w.w
			compiler
				compiler.w
				grammar
					grammar.w
					program.w
					statement.w
					expression.w
					identifier.w
				symbol
				token
				codegen
			type
				...specified in types.txt





Global structure:

/
	owners admin:w
	w
		owners w,?
	bin
		TBD
	users
		w
			owners admin:w
			private
				owners w,private
		otheruser
			owners admin:otheruser
			private
				owners otheruser,private
		... 100 billion users
	shared
		owners admin:w
	experimental
		owners *, admin:w
